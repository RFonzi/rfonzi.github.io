<p>
I'm a software developer focusing on Android.
</p>

<p>
  I'm very interested in software architecture and emerging trends.
  Which is one of the reasons why most of my recent projects were made with <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/"><img style="display: inline" src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/kotlin-1.svg" height="18px" width="18px"/>otlin</a>.
  Feel free to <a href="/projects">check some of them out</a>.
